## Assets üìÅ
Most aspects of the game were created by me, including scripts, models, animation, visual effects and user interface.  

### 3rd party
Heart and Volume textures were slightly modified from the originals found at https://flaticons.net/.  
Custom font was found at https://www.fontspace.com/party-confetti-font-f69513.  
Low poly texture palettes are from [Imphenzia](https://www.youtube.com/c/Imphenzia) (used for UV mapping). 

All sounds and soundtrack used were taken from the following *commercial* assets:
- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/ultimate-sound-fx-bundle-151756
- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/orchestral/ultimate-game-music-collection-37351
- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/universal-sound-fx-17256

Since they are commercial, they are excluded from this repository.  
It is possible to build the game without these assets, but the game will have no sound in that case.
